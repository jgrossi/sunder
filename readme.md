# Sunder Wordpress Plugin

> Sunder allows you to separate logic and view files inside Wordpress themes, making your code cleaner.

## Installation

Just clone this repo inside a `sunder` folder inside your `wp-content/plugins` folder or install it using Wordpress Plugin page. After copy the folder contents just activate the plugin inside your Wordpress Administration area.

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins
git clone git@github.com:jgrossi/sunder.git sunder
```

## Usage

Generally when fetching data from a Wordpress database in a theme you use just one file, like `page.php` for example. In this file you have HTML code and PHP code to query WP posts to be shown in the theme file.

This plugin separates logic from views. The same `page.php` file will be the *logic* file, where you will have only the PHP code:

```php
<?php /* Template Name: Services */

$content = str_replace('%AGE%', get_age(), $post->post_content);
$content = wpautop($content);

$topics = get_field('topics');
$video = get_field('video');
$gallery = get_field('gallery');

return render('views/services', compact('content', 'topics', 'video', 'gallery'));
```

Now you are calling the view file, sending `$content`, `$topics`, `$video` and `$gallery` variables to it. This file is located in `views/services`. By default the `.php` extension is used to load the file.

In the view file you can get the variables as a `$view` property, like `$view->gallery`. The `views/services.php` file will look like:

```php
<?php get_header() ?>
<!-- HTML code -->
<p class="content"><?php echo $view->content ?></p>
<ul class="gallery">
    <?php foreach ($view->gallery as $pic): ?>
        <li><?php echo $pic['url'] ?></li>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
<!-- more HTML code using $view->var -->
```

I prefer to use the template files inside a `views` folder, but you can use the name you want.
